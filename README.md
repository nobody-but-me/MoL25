# MoL Game Engine: an atomic game engine.
*I don't even know how many times I have started and rewrote this engine, but here we are, once again*.

MoL is a 2D focused game engine being produced by me. It's written in C++ and its renderer uses OpenGL. Its main goal is to be a modular yet simple to learn game engine, as well as to be my toy game engine -- which means that I have no plans to ever finish it, at all.

With that said, all the intention upon this game engine is, pure and essentially, recreational, except for its use in my portfolio/resume.
